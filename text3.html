        <p>As you heard of computers, it is a very ordinary business but my computer business 
            is very different, when you have a computer and when the electricity shuts down your 
            all the data goes away.  So people buy a ups and it is huge and cant fit on you desk 
            and if you do you don’t have enough space to have your keyboard and mouse
        </p>
            <p1>
            So I built an idea that I will design the case that can hold an inbuilt ups and make a pc 
            in it that can connect on a pc easily and save you space a lot.
            When the space is gone you pc setup will look aesthetically pleasing and will have 
            good management.</p1>
